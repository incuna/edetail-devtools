# eDetail devtools

Little helpers for eDetail development.

Initially setup to ease development of any eDetail in Chrome, since an update around Chrome 36/37 is halting some JS when it thinks the page is scrolling and so `webkitTransitionEnd` never fires after swiping which means the slide never changes.
